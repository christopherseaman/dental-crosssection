# Cross-Sectional Anatomy Curriculum Project

## Project Description and Abstract

This project intends to develop an integrated cross-sectional anatomy curriculum within the first-year anatomy course at UCSF to prime dental students with spatial ability skills and improve diagnostic imaging interpretation capabilities. Annotations on large cross-sectional foam boards will allow learners to collaborate as they understand anatomical structures in different dimensions and planes, leveraging the advantages of visuospatial modalities that cross-sections provide to bridge the gap between anatomical knowledge and clinical practice. Assessments will determine the intervention's strengths regarding diagnostic interpretation capabilities and surveys will underscore self-reported confidence in preparation for clinical exercises.

## Methods

A needs assessment survey will be offered to dental students to understand their level of preparedness for interpreting diagnostic images following the anatomy and radiology courses they took. During the lab, first-year dental students annotate unlabeled posterboards, working with their lab groups. The students then rotate around the other group’s posterboards to fill in or correct labels before answers are revealed. Participants are randomly split into 2 groups: one experimental group that will be asked to identify structures on radiological images only and one control group that will take a similar test to the pretest. Lastly, a posttest survey is intended at gauging student satisfaction and feedback regarding the cross-sectional curriculum, as well as the experimental test’s ability in measuring knowledge acquisition.

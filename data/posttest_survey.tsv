12/3/24 11:50	12/3/24 11:51	S2841	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	I think it would be helpful to practice differentiating different types of images MRI vs CT. 	I had a great time! Thanks Daania! 
12/3/24 11:49	12/3/24 11:51	S2834	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Somewhat agree	Doing it in smaller groups, it was hard to look at the cross sections due to so many people crowding around it.	
12/3/24 11:50	12/3/24 11:51	S2848	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	More time! And also an answer key for each station so we can confirm our answers 	It was really awesome and super helpful, just hope we had more time for each station :)
12/3/24 11:49	12/3/24 11:53	S2852	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Very very minor gripe, but some of the images had spatial resolution that was too low to interpret finer structures. If the goal is to be able to identify these structures, it might be worth getting a higher quality image and print. 	Altogether I REALLY enjoyed it! It was well run and super engaging. Would highly recommend giving other students the opportunity to do this as well.

12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:54	S2855	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	instead of two groups working together per table, have just one group because it was too many people working one image. 	
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:54	S2849	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Somewhat agree	Maybe a quick overview of structures to help orient ourselves, and tips to 	I enjoyed it, was a little rushed as this is something new, it required more time for orientation to then identify structures 
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:54	S2817	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Strongly disagree	More materials - too many people trying to work on one thing at one time so I couldn't really see or participate a lot of the time	
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:54	S2851	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	I think it'd be more helpful to have the diagrams to fill out on our iPads rather than one copy for the whole class. I felt like that was more passive learning because beyond the first station we were just kind of looking at what other people labeled and not figuring it out ourselves. I would've liked to be able to try each one out myself and then compare with the answer key	It was helpful overall!
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:54	S2826	diagnostic-images		Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Somewhat agree	I believe if we were more exposed to examples prior to the radiological images in lectures prior to this session, it would've been more helpful.	It was an interesting experience since I haven't encountered radiological images before. It was great to learn these images since we would have to know it for our upcoming careers.
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:55	S2827	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Strongly agree	Honestly, I liked the format of the lab, being able to collaborate with my peers. It might have been interesting to include abnormal radiological images as well, for example, tumors, to have more of a clinical application.	I really enjoyed this lab, where I was able to apply things we've learned to real radiological imagesâ€¦I felt like a radiologist. 
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:55	s2836	diagnostic-images	I have worked with or analyzed radiological images prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	I would make it an at home assignment.	It was a good experience, I learned something for sure.
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:55	s2829	cross-section	I took a course in radiology prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Somewhat agree	I thought it was great, if anything maybe just giving us smaller groups to work in, in order for us to get more hands on experience. 	
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:55	S2806	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	I wish we knew to compare the CT and MRI images earlier at first out group was only looking at the donar crossections	I see the benefit and it helped introduce me to seeing the landmarks in CT and MRIs 
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:55	S2862	diagnostic-images		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	A crash course on how to read CT scans and MRI scans would be helpful. I'm still not sure what the coloration of the CT and MRI scans mean or what we can see on them. Are we able to see the soft tissues in MRI scans or only bone? Also, the lab only focused on the main general images rather than the CT scans, so I thought the quiz was difficult.	I liked having the radiograph session a lot! Looking through the identified structures later will definitely help me practice. I think something that would be super helpful would be having a Powerpoint presentation where we can click through and test ourselves on structures, similar to the one we had for identifying the skull. That way, we can quiz ourselves! Thanks so much. 
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:55	S2825	cross-section	I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Somewhat agree	I wish there were more boards to write on or a PDF provided on the CLE so that we can write on our iPads instead. It was definitely harder to look at the board together with 8 people.	Overall, a great review. Wished there were more boards we can write on. 
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:55	S2808	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	I think having smaller tables where you can start locating things from a blank image, then regrouping later to go over the images would work better. It was hard to check others' work and also try to figure out how much progress others had made in order to add to what they were missing.	It was fun! definitely helps a lot to practice the cross sectional images since most of the images of the slides are from axial or top bottom. It was slightly challenging and engaging.
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:55	S2811		I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Strongly agree	Thank you 	Thank you 
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:55	s2801	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I took a course in radiology prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I have worked with or analyzed radiological images prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	I would say having another board so the two groups can each work independently.	It was a very helpful experience, will just need to study the answer keys as viewing the images and making sense of them was confusing.
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:55	S2822	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Strongly agree	Nothing to change everything was perfect I like this class a lot I wish we can have it every single day	Nothing to change everything was perfect I like this class a lot I wish we can have it every single day
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:55	S2861	diagnostic-images		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Incorporating more image in lecture as we first learn about the concept 	This lab would be more helpful if the answer key is also provided (or have some sort of mean to explain why this structure is what it is (eg its attachment, its position etc)
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:55	S2864	cross-section	I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	I think this lab is pretty good overall in terms of contents. It might be more helpful to post a pdf of the cross-sectional images to cle so we can all have access to it on our tablet.	I feel like this lab is a good exposure in terms of analyzing anatomical images and gives us a better sense of what can happen in the real world.
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:55	S2813	diagnostic-images	I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	A digital version of this lab would be fantastic, one major limitation was that in the short time at each station we could not all inspect each image thoroughly. If we could have the images on Google drive or some other cloud collaborative platform it would be easier since most of us have personal devices to access these.	
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:55	S2809	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I took a course in radiology prior to matriculation at UCSF.,I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Somewhat agree	I think it would be helpful for each group to start from scratch at each table. After the first table my group started at, every other picture was already fully labeled and we felt as though there wasn't much left to do. 	I really enjoyed this activity! Thank you Dania for putting it together, I think it'll help me with future radiographic interpretations!
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:55	2853	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Have anwser key near by 	It went really well! Learned a lot although some images easier than others 
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:56	S2824	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	It would be helpful to have some sort of answer key so we could compare our answers.	I enjoyed this experience of working with my labmates to identify the key structures we have been learning on radiographic images. It was interesting to see different variations and characteristics that were present and I feel prepared to apply this knowledge in the future!
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:56	S2816	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	n/a	Helpful review

Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Somewhat agree	I think it would've been helpful to label the radiological images & then use the cadaveric images as comparison.	Overall, I very happy with the experience, and I feel more confident labeling the radiological images.

12/3/24 11:55	12/3/24 11:56	S2846	diagnostic-images		Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Somewhat agree	It'd be nice to have 2 answer banks and maybe 2 cross sections to analyze, I felt it was hard to see or give input depending on where I was standing at the table	Thanks for putting it together!
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:56	S2830	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Neither agree nor disagree	Groups were too large, so not everyone got a chance to practice their own active recall. 	Had a group member that took up too much space without explaining or helping the rest of the group. Was very frustrating because they were adamant about their knowledge and were not receptive to feedback from the group
12/3/24 11:55	12/3/24 11:56	S2844	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Smaller groups	
12/3/24 11:55	12/3/24 11:56	S2833	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Strongly agree		
12/3/24 11:52	12/3/24 11:56	S2839	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Somewhat agree	I think this lab was definitely helpful in giving us more exposure to cross sections! I do think that it would be helpful to guide us in identifying landmarks before throwing us into the activity. I think we were still pretty lost going into it at first. I also wish there was even more help in terms of CT scans and MRIs. By the time we were gonna go over them, we ran out of time. 	Overall I do appreciate the new exposure but do think there's needs more guidance to help facilitate it as it was also hard to share each image between 8 people. 
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:56	S2856	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	I think the cross sections are a bit blurry and dark when printed out. It may be nicer to label on a pdf. We could all collaborate with labeling on the same document. Our group didn't use the MRI/CT images as much.	8 people per section felt a bit too much. 
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:56	S2804	cross-section	I have worked with or analyzed radiological images prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	I think there should be more of a connection made between the radiographs and cross sections. Due to limited time, most of us disregarded the mris and ct images and did not make landmark connections. Also, the cross section level seemed to be inaccurate for many stations.	This was so fun!! It was an awesome review of the quarter and I really feel like i benefited. My feedback above pertains to the intended purpose of exposing us to radiograph images which I feel was not what I took away from the session despite feeling like I learned a lot 
12/3/24 11:55	12/3/24 11:56	S2854	diagnostic-images		Somewhat agree	Somewhat disagree	Somewhat agree	It would be nice if were were given a key and asked to memorize because right now there is a chance we learned something that others labeled that was wrong 	Overall it was a nice holistic experience but it would have helped to receive a debrief session with correct answers.

Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	I would appreciate more radiographs resources as sharing with a large group was difficult given the short time per station 	
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:56	S2863	diagnostic-images	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat disagree	Somewhat agree	I think it would be nice to label each diagram from scratch. That way, i can come to conclusions by my self vs what the prior group thought	An answer key in class could be useful to confirm/deny our responses. As a whole, this was pretty useful as i think most of us struggle on this topic
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:56	S2859	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Somewhat agree	More time with each of the images and having an answer key to compare our interpretations to. 	Great experience, felt like we received a lot of practice in getting better at radiographic interpretations. 
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:56	S2805	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat disagree	I think we should do more of interpreting radiological images throughout the quarter 	I enjoyed the session, we should sprinkle more of this in lab and throughout the quarter 
12/3/24 11:55	12/3/24 11:57	2828	diagnostic-images		Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Neither agree nor disagree		I do think these radiograph sessions are help. We should incorporate more of this into our curriculum.
12/3/24 11:53	12/3/24 11:57	S2831	cross-section		Somewhat agree	Strongly agree	Neither agree nor disagree	I think having us work with the actual medical CT images more directly would be useful as I had a tendency to just look at the colored/stained images which were more familiar to me.	It was a great opportunity to review course content and get primary exposure to CT images!
12/3/24 11:54	12/3/24 11:58	S2857	diagnostic-images	I received an X-Ray license prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Somewhat agree	If the goal is to be able to identify radiographic images, there should be less of a focus on labeling the cross-section because it takes time away from looking at the CT and MRIs. Instead, I think it would be more beneficial to see a labelled cross section with less terms and try to identify the same structures in the radiographs provided. 	It took a lot of time to label/go through the cross sections and the radiographs were new to us, so without help from faculty, we were unsure what we were looking at.

Somewhat agree	Neither agree nor disagree	Neither agree nor disagree	If we could see the imagines on our tablet. 	It was too many people for one image. I would have learned better had it been a good clear imagine on our tablets and if we could work in our group of 4 rather than 8. 
12/3/24 11:55	12/3/24 11:58	S2837	cross-section	I took an anatomy course prior to matriculation at UCSF.	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Somewhat agree	Labeling the radiological images rather than donor cross section's would have been more useful if the goal of the lab was to help us identify structures on X-RAYS. This was helpful in helping refresh my memory of structures but not as helpful for identifying images on radiographs. I don't think we had enough time to identify on the radiographs and the donor pictures. Because we were told to write on the donor pictures instead of the radiographs I don't feel any improvement in my knowledge of analyzing the x-rays.

Somewhat agree	Somewhat disagree	Neither agree nor disagree	5 minutes for each station was a bit too quick and there were too many people at each station.

I like this collaborative set up but I think it could've been a bit more organized.

I wouldn't have thought to review cross sections so I'm
Glad we had this lab. "
